Meteor simple navigation app example for re-route issue with dburles:google-maps package

HTML file for map is in client/views/ui/map.html
Script for map is in client/views/ui/map.coffee
Style for map-container is in client/style/base.import.less
Routes are in lib/router/main.coffee

I'm using yogiben:meteor-starter for boilerplates so it might be an issue (maybe some incompatibilities between packages). Sorry for the unnecessary codes.
